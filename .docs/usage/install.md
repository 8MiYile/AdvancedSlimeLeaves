### How to install ASWM

Installing ASWM is an easy task. First, download the latest version of the plugin and server jar. Then, follow this step:
1. Place the downloaded `slimeworldmanager-plugin-<version>.jar` file inside your server's plugin folder.
2. Place the `slimeworldmanager-server-<version>.jar` file inside your server's main directory.
3. Modify your server startup command to instead run that same server jar.
```
java -jar "slimeworldmanager-server-<version>.jar"
```
